Given a collection of employee objects. Each employee has who reports them directly and time it takes to propogate a message to each one of these reports. 
CEO wants to send a message through reporting structure to all employees and wants minimum number of days required to inform all the employees

Example: Employee: {"A", reports=[{B,1}, {C,2}]}, Employee: {"B", reports=[{D,1}, {E,2}]}
A-B-D-H : 5
A-B-E : 3
A-C-F : 4
A-C-G : 3
Minimum days required if 5 to inform all employees

Thinking process:
1. Consider the reporting structure as tree, we need to find sum of days from root to each leaf nodes, i.e CEO to each juniormost employees
2. So we will have to compute sum of each such paths to every leaf node.
3. We can use DFS to start from root and and reach leaf nodes.
4. While doing DFS we can compute sum on each depth's path, when we reach a leaf node we can store the sum of days reqd to reach that leaf node.
5. At the end we want MAX of all such paths to leaf nodes.
6. Instead of storing all sums, we can have a MAX variable to compare final sum of each path and replace if we see a larger sum.
