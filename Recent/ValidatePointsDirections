You are given various statements regarding some points and the direction between them. Check if all the statements are correct or not.

For example:

P1 is in North of P2
P2 is in North of P3
P3 is in North of P1

Output: False (since P3 will be in South of P1)

Directions can be N,S,W,E,NW,NE,SW, etc.

APPROACH:

Let B -> A, a directed edge from B to A, represent the inequality of A > B.
Let B = A, a bi-directed edge between B and A, represent the equality of B = A.

We can now model the relationship of all 8 directions N/E/S/W/NE/SE/SW/NW:

For each statement, e.g. P1 is in North of P2, it means that x_p1 == x_p2 and y_p1 > y_p2,
so we can then form the following two edges between P1 and P2:

for x-plane, P2 = P2 (equality edge)
for y-plane, P1 <- P2 (inequality edge)

STEPS:
  1. Create two graphs for x-plane and y-plane
  2. For each statement add an edge in x-plane and y-plane. Based on the statements we would add an equality and inequality edge
  3. Do a DFS(cycle detection) for both the graphs. 
  4. If cycle is detected and all edges are equality edges then its valid. But if cycle is detected and path consists of any inequality edge. Its violation
